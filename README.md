# image-matching-with-r2d2-and-opencv
In this repository, we will match paired images using R2D2 algorithm.

This is done in three steps:
1. Extracting keypoints using R2D2
2. match images with OpenCV
3. Display the image

Output:

![paired matched image with r2d2](https://github.com/abdollah-semej/image-matching-with-r2d2-and-opencv/blob/main/output/matched%20image.png?raw=true)
